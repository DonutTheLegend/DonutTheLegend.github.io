      <blockquote> The official language is English, but it is spoken less frequently in rural areas and amongst people with lower education levels. Other major languages spoken include: Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Fulfulde, Ibibio, Kanuri, and Tiv. Nigerian Sign Language, Hausa Sign Language, and Bura Sign Language are all used in Nigeria. </blockquote>

      <h2> Category #2: Fashion </h2>
      <div style="height:1000px;background-color:silver;font-size:36px" id="d2">
        <p> Nigerians usually dress casually because of the hot climate. However, both formal and traditional clothing are also worn. Many African cultures have a characteristic traditional style of dress that is important to their heritage. </p>
      <blockquote> Popular for its elegance, Northern Nigerian fashion consists of a lot of layering. The kaftan worn by the men is usually accompanied by a loose baban riga over it. The hula, or cap, accessorizes this outfit. For women, an ankara blouse and skirt or dress is usually accompanied by a complementing veil. </blockquote>

      <h2> Category #3: Food </h2>
      <div style="height:1000px;background-color:orange;font-size:36px" id="d3">
      1. Rice: Rice is by far the most common food in Nigeria and has been so for a long time. It is grown mostly in the Northern part of Nigeria because the climate suits rice farming. Apart from the Northern part of Nigeria, rice is also grown in the South-East, particularly Ebonyi state, and precisely in Abakaliki.

      <p> 
      Nigerian cuisine is usually rich in protein, with ingredients such as mutton, chicken, beef, or fish. Seafood such as clams, snails, prawns, crabs, and periwinkles are popular ingredients used in soups and stews. </p>

      <blockquote> Traditional foods have a historic tie to a certain culture or region, often passed down from generation to generation. From Indian curry to Italian rag√π, these meals hold strong connections to their places of origin with delicious flavors and spices! </blockquote>
